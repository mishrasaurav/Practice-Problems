Take as input S, a string. Write a function that does basic string compression. Print the value returned. E.g. for input “aaabbccds” print out a3b2c2d1s1.

Input Format
A single String S

Constraints
1 < = length of String < = 100

Output Format
The compressed String.

Sample Input
aaabbccds
Sample Output
a3b2c2d1s1
Explanation
In the given sample test case 'a' is repeated 3 times consecutively, 'b' is repeated twice, 'c' is repeated twice and 'd and 's' occurred only once.

#include<iostream>
#include<cstring>
using namespace std;
int main() {
string str;
getline(cin,str);
int n=str.length();

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { 
	int count = 1;
	while(i<n-1 && str[i]==str[i+1]){
		count++;
		i++;
	}
	cout<<str[i]<<count;
}
}
